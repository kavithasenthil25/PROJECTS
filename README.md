* ### ML PROJECTS
  1. [Census Income Analysis](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Census%20Income%20project.ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50K a year or less by using ML Algorithms using "Census Income" dataset from the UCI ML Repository containing income information of 48,000 
      individuals taken from the 1994 US Census.
 
  3. [Covid-19 Analysis](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Covid19%20project.ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to visualize the impact and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current trends.

 * ### HR ANALYTICS
   
    [HR Analytics Statistics](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/HR_Analytics_Statistics.ipynb)

       HR analytics involves analyzing, and interpreting data related to various HR functions, including recruitment, talent management, employee engagement...
       Organizations leverage HR analytics to gain deeper insights to make data-driven decisions and align HR initiatives with organizational goals.
       This project involves HypothesisTesting (Null&Alternate Hypothesis) with T-test ,Z-test, F-Statistic test to analyze the dataset.

 * ### TIME SERIES FORECASTING

    [WALMART RETAIL STORE ANALYSIS AND FORECASTING](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Time%20Series-%20Walmart.ipynb)

        The objective of this project is to provide deeper insights using the given store dataset and to make prediction models to forecast the store sales for coming weeks to
        solve the inventory issues of outlets to match the demand with respect to supply.
