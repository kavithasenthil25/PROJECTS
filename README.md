## CONTENTS

* ### ML PROJECTS
  1. [Census Income Analysis](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Census%20Income%20project.ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50K a year or less by using ML Algorithms using "Census Income" dataset from the UCI ML Repository containing income information of 48,000 
      individuals taken from the 1994 US Census.
 
  3. [Covid-19 Analysis](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Covid19%20project.ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to visualize the impact and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current trends.

 * ### HR ANALYTICS
   
    [HR Analytics Statistics](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/HR_Analytics_Statistics.ipynb)

       HR analytics involves analyzing, and interpreting data related to various HR functions, including recruitment, talent management, employee engagement...
       Organizations leverage HR analytics to gain deeper insights to make data-driven decisions and align HR initiatives with organizational goals.
       This project involves HypothesisTesting (Null&Alternate Hypothesis) with T-test ,Z-test, F-Statistic test to analyze the dataset.

 * ### TIME SERIES FORECASTING

    [WALMART RETAIL STORE ANALYSIS AND FORECASTING](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Time%20Series-%20Walmart.ipynb)

        The objective of this project is to provide deeper insights using the given store dataset and to make prediction models to forecast the store sales for coming weeks to
        solve the inventory issues of outlets to match the demand with respect to supply.

 * ### AI PROJECTS
   1.[CNN (CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK)](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/CNN%20(AI).ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to build a CNN as well as pretrained models using Tensorflow on a given dataset and evaluate the performance of both models. 

   2.[CANCER CLASSIFICATION PROJECT (AI)](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/CANCER%20CLASSIFICATION%20%20(AI).ipynb)

      The objective of this project is to perform a predictive task of classification based on the factors which lead upto a patient having cancer. Breast Cancer Dataset is used for classification .
      GAUSSIANNB , KNN , MLP CLASSIFIER are used for classification.

   3.[KERAS (AI)](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/keras%20(AI).ipynb)

      The main objective of this project is to find out whether the patient is Diabetic or Not . Classification problem done by building a sequential model using Keras on Diabetes dataset.

   4.[TENSORFLOW (AI)](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/Tensorflow%20(AI).ipynb)

      The project is based on House Price Detection on Boston Dataset by building a sequential model with Relu Activation function using tensorflow and keras.

  * ### NLP (Natural Language Processing)

      [TEXT CLASSIFICATION PROJECT]([TEXT CLASSIFICATION (NLP)](https://github.com/kavithasenthil25/PROJECTS/blob/main/NLP-TextClassification.ipynb) )
